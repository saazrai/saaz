## Key Findings

### Overall Status
- **Total Domains**: 20
- **Complete Domains**: 0
- **Domains Needing Work**: 20 (100%)

### Most Critical Issues

1. **D1 (General Security Concepts)**: 
   - **83 total questions** (+33 over target)
   - **48 Level 1 questions** (+41 over target)
   - Severely imbalanced toward basic recall questions

2. **D8 (Cryptography & Key Management)**:
   - **61 total questions** (+11 over target)
   - Too many Level 2 and 3 questions

3. **D7 (Threat & Vulnerability Management)**:
   - **59 total questions** (+9 over target)
   - Generally well-distributed but needs pruning

4. **D11 (Network & Communication Security)**:
   - **58 total questions** (+8 over target)
   - Excess in lower-level questions

### Domains Closest to Target

1. **D16 (Security Awareness & Human Factors)**:
   - **50 total questions** (✅ correct total)
   - Only needs minor Bloom level adjustments: -1 L1, +1 L3

2. **D2 (Information Security Governance)**:
   - **48 total questions** (-2 from target)
   - Needs rebalancing toward lower levels

3. **D13 (Cloud Security)**:
   - **48 total questions** (-2 from target)
   - Needs more Level 3 questions

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Address Major Imbalances
1. **D1**: Reduce Level 1 questions by 41, increase Level 2 by 8
2. **D8**: Remove 11 excess questions, rebalance distribution
3. **D7**: Remove 9 excess questions while maintaining good balance

### Priority 2: Standardize to 50 Questions
Focus on domains with correct or near-correct totals:
- D16: Minor adjustments only
- D2, D13: Add 2 questions each with proper distribution

### Priority 3: Systematic Rebalancing
Address remaining domains systematically, focusing on:
- Achieving exactly 50 questions per domain
- Maintaining the 7-10-16-10-7 Bloom distribution
- Ensuring question quality and relevance

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Audit Phase**: Review all questions for quality and relevance
2. **Pruning Phase**: Remove excess questions, prioritizing lower-quality items
3. **Creation Phase**: Develop new questions to fill gaps
4. **Validation Phase**: Ensure proper Bloom taxonomy alignment
5. **Testing Phase**: Validate question difficulty and discrimination

This analysis shows that significant work is needed across all domains to meet the business requirement of 50 questions per domain with proper Bloom taxonomy distribution.
