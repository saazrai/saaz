# Phase Tracking Simplification Summary

## Changes Made

### Database Schema
1. **Renamed column**: `current_phase_id` → `phase_id` 
2. **Removed redundant columns**:
   - `current_phase` - Use `phase->order_sequence` instead
   - `phases_completed` - Linear progression, derive from current phase
   - `phase_progress` - Can be calculated from responses
   - `current_domain` - Can be calculated from responses

### Model Updates
- Updated `Diagnostic` model fillable fields and casts
- Renamed relationship: `currentPhase()` → `phase()`
- Updated `isPhaseCompleted()` to calculate based on phase order

### Controller Updates
- Updated all references to use `phase_id` instead of `current_phase_id`
- Updated references to use `phase->order_sequence` instead of `current_phase`
- Simplified phase completion logic
- Removed redundant phase tracking code

### Test Updates
- Updated test factories to use `phase_id`
- Updated test assertions to check `phase->order_sequence`
- Updated test setup to create phase records

### Console Commands
- Updated `DiagnosticSummary` and `AnalyzeDiagnostic` commands to use new schema

### Migration Strategy
- Modified original migration file (dev mode approach per CODING-STANDARDS.md)
- No separate migration created since we're in development

## Benefits
1. **Simplified schema** - Removed 4 redundant columns
2. **Cleaner code** - Less state to manage
3. **Data integrity** - Single source of truth for phase
4. **Easier maintenance** - Less complex phase tracking logic

## Rationale
Since the diagnostic follows linear progression (Phase 1→2→3→4), we only need to track the current phase. All other phase-related data can be derived:
- Completed phases = all phases with order < current phase order
- Phase progress = calculated from domain responses
- Current domain = determined from response data
